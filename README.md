# AudioLAN

Stream microphone from Android device over LAN. The intent is to work with a (python) UDP server that plots the raw audio signal in realtime. For UDP server code, see this project: <a href="https://github.com/johnharakas/AudioScope">AudioScope</a>


On the Android device, proper permissions must be given the app.
